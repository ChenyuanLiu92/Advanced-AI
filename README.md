# Image Classifications in CIFAR-10
## 1. Introduction
 Using ViT, VGG and ResNet models to classify images on CIFAR-10.
 You can change parameters in model folders and run.py.
 We don't support visualization training processes, you can realize visualization functions based on the project.
 Attention: The CNN model is not supported,(Author is trying to build a great model with high accuracy.) and ResNet also has some limitations(but ResNet18 can be used).
 To be continued...
